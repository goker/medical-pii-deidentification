# LinkedIn Post - Local-First Medical AI

## Post Content (Copy this to LinkedIn)

```
I want every small clinic to have access to the same AI that big hospital chains use.

Last week, OpenMed released 34 state-of-the-art medical PII detection models.

These are the BEST open-source medical NER models available. 95%+ accuracy.

But here's the problem:
- Most healthcare facilities can't use them
- Enterprise solutions cost thousands per month
- Cloud APIs require sending PHI to third parties
- Small clinics and rural hospitals are left behind

So I built something different.

LOCAL-FIRST medical PII removal that runs on ANY laptop:

✅ Runs 100% on your machine - PHI never leaves
✅ Works on CPU only - no expensive GPU needed
✅ 2GB RAM is enough - runs on basic hardware
✅ One command to start - no ML expertise required
✅ Open source - inspect every line of code

The model (OpenMed-PII-SuperClinical-Small-44M):
• 95.4% F1 score on clinical text
• 54 PII entity types detected
• All 18 HIPAA identifiers covered
• 44M parameters - small enough for any computer

What it does:

Input: "Patient John Smith, SSN: 123-45-6789"
Output: "Patient [NAME], SSN: [SSN]"

HIPAA compliance in milliseconds. On your local machine.

Who this is for:
🏥 Rural hospitals with limited IT budgets
🏨 Small clinics protecting patient privacy
🔬 Medical researchers handling sensitive data
💻 Healthcare startups building HIPAA-compliant apps
🎓 Students learning clinical NLP

Healthcare data protection shouldn't be a luxury only enterprises can afford.
